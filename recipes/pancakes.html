    <h1>Amazing Pancakes</h1>
    <img src="../images/pancakes.webp" alt="pancakes" height="500" width="500">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These hearty pancakes are flavored with buckwheat and coconut. Don't expect a smooth-appearing cake. These pancakes appear lumpy because of the buckwheat groats. Even though these are wheat-free, they are not gluten-free! The honey may not be needed in the pancakes if you will be putting a sweet touch on the finished pancakes.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup buckwheat groats</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups boiling water</li>
        <li>1 cup spelt flour</li>
        <li>½ cup unsweetened shredded coconut</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 cup soy milk</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons honey (Optional)</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place buckwheat groats in a bowl. Pour boiling water over groats and set aside for groats to absorb water, about 10 minutes. Retain water if it doesn't all absorb.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, coconut, and baking powder together in a separate bowl. Beat milk, egg, oil, and honey together in a third bowl. Stir buckwheat groats mixture and flour mixture into milk mixture until just combined.</li>
        <li>Spray skillet with cooking spray. Pour batter, 1/4 to 1/3 cup per pancake, into heated skillet. Cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 more minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
    </ol>
