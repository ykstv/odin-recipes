    <img src="../images/oats.webp" alt="oats" height="500" width="500">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A variation from overnight oats recipe from Alli Shircliff. This is for anyone who doesn't/can't eat oatmeal but wants a delicious, fast, and healthy breakfast. This uses buckwheat flakes--not the cereal flakes but rolled and flaked buckwheat. They look very similar to oatmeal flakes but are much smaller. Mix in agave and berries. Eat and enjoy!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>¼ cup buckwheat flakes</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chia seeds</li>

        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>⅓ cup milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mixed berries</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon agave</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine buckwheat, chia seeds, 1 1/2 teaspoons coconut, flax seed meal, cinnamon, and vanilla powder in a jar; stir until well mixed. Stir in milk; cover. Place in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
